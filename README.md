### [GAME OF THRONES](https://github.com/EddyEdgar/Projects/blob/main/GAME_OF_THRONES_EDA.ipynb)

This project explores the movie; Game of Thrones using Exploratory Data Analysis.
The link to the dataset used can be found in the notebook.
This notebook includes the cleaning of Game of Thrones data as well as the use of Exploratory Analysis to extract information from the data.

<B>Pandas</B>, <B>Seaborn</B>, <B>Matplotlib</B>, and <B>Numpy</B> are the libraries used in the notebook.

<B>Box plots</B>, <B>heatmaps</B>, <B>histograms</B>, <B>density plots</B>, <B>scatter plots</B>, <B>violin plots</B>, <B>KDE</B>, and <B>line plots</B> are the tools used in the notebook. The notebook also depicts some relationships between the dataset's variables.

### [IBM EMPLOYEE ATTRITION](https://github.com/EddyEdgar/Projects/blob/main/IBM%20EMPLOYEE%20ATTRITION_EDA.ipynb)
An exploratory analysis of the IBM employee attrition dataset.

EDA

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a method for better understanding your data and assisting in subsequent data preprocessing. It is the critical process of conducting preliminary data investigations to discover patterns, identify anomalies, test hypotheses, and validate assumptions using summary statistics and graphical representations. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a step in the Data Analysis Process that employs a variety of techniques to better understand the dataset under consideration. Exploratory Data Analysis accomplishes two major tasks:

It aids in the cleanup of a dataset.
It improves your understanding of the variables and their relationships. EDA assists in gathering insights and making better sense of data, as well as removing irregularities and unnecessary values from data, aids in preparing dataset for analysis, enables a machine learning model to predict dataset more accurately, also aids in the selection of a better machine learning model. This project extracts, cleans and visualizes the dataset from the IBM employee attrition and the possible factors for employee attrition using sql and pandas. Employee attrition is the process of workers leaving a company for a variety of reasons, either voluntary or involuntary, without being immediately replaced. Employee attrition refers to the gradual reduction in the number of employees. Employee attrition occurs when your workforce shrinks over time. This means that employees are being hired at a faster rate than they are being replaced. Employee attrition occurs when a worker retires, resigns, or is not replaced. The project processes include; Data Extraction Data Cleaning Data Analysis Data Interpretation The link to the dataset used in this project is attached in the notebook.


### [SALARY MODEL](https://github.com/EddyEdgar/Projects/blob/main/SALARY_MODEL.ipynb)

### [STUDENT STUDY PREDICTION](https://github.com/EddyEdgar/Projects/blob/main/STUDENT_STUDY_PREDICTION.ipynb)
This project predicts the percentage of a student based on the no. of study hours. It used simple linear regression as it involves just 2 variables.
